# Movie Recommend
- In **Python** folder, I used svd and ItemCF to recommend movies.
- In **Hadoop** folder, the algorithm is implemented in hadoop.
- The hadoop java code has some reference to [用Hadoop构建电影推荐系统](http://blog.fens.me/hadoop-mapreduce-recommend/)
- The dataset is from [netflix](http://www.lifecrunch.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nf_prize_dataset.tar.gz)
